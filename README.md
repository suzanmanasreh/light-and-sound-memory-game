## Reflection Questions
<ol>
  <li>If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. </li>
  <ul>
    <li>I watched this youtube video to help me understand JavaScript concepts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c</li>
    <li>This website helped me change the shapes of the buttons: https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/</li>
  </ul>
  <li>What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>I didn’t really have many challenges making my game because the instructions were so clear about what to do. 
However, I did struggle to understand what exactly we were doing at each step though because I’m not too familiar with JavaScript and CSS, so the syntax was completely new to me, and I had to thoroughly read the descriptions for what things like the DOM and functions are to understand.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>How are modern websites made to look so good? </li>
    <li>How do we create nice boxes and position things in the right area? </li>
    <li>How do we make a user interact with a website and submit information to it? </li>
    <li>Where does all the information we input into a website go and how is it stored? </li>
    <li>Is there a simpler way to develop websites than manually typing in html/css/js code?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) </li>
  <ul>
    <li>I would add images to each button to make it so the user is clicking an image, not an arbitrary colored circle. I also want to give my game a theme and make the images tie in with the theme. In addition, I would try to increase the difficulty of the game by adding a lot more buttons that the user needs to press or speeding up the game even more.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
